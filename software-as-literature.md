# Software as literature

by David Whitney

Intentional code

Software is a constrained form of literature that communicates concepts from programmer to programmer and eventually gets interpreted by a computer.

Clean code = bad book: very dogmatic.

We use paragraph in text.
Removing them reduce sens.
Putting empty line everywhere remove too.

Code has rhythm.

Software should be at most as complex as the problem space it habits, and no greater

Design in its place and time: le baladeur K7 de Sony a un design incroyable, pour un baladeur K7. Mais ce design ne fais plus ens aujourd'hui. C'est là même chose pour certains design patterns, ils sont à remettre dans leur contexte et à confronter au problème qu'on cherche à résoudre.

Structural design is often too big.

Stop doing thing _because_.
Answer why.

It’s a war against complexity.

What is good code ?
- Readability,
- Code where intent take more place than language

Different contexts = different solutions
