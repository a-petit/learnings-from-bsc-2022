# Agility != speed

Speed = The way it ended up being measured

You cannot « do » agility
- Agile is an adjective, an observable property.
- You can do scrum, you can do kanban, but you cannot "do" agility. 
- Agile is more a philosophy, an attitude.

Also, this evolves: agile in 2002 != agile in 2022

Every word as an origin story:
- Everywhere, we talk about productivity. 
- "Productive" comes the manufacture, the factory. 
- In a factory, it's easy to measure how much product you produce each day. It's a metaphor. 

What can we measure ?

- **Lines of code** ? The less you have for same functionalities, often the better! LoC is a terrible measure of productivity. And if you want to measure my productivity through  this indicator, I can be very creative to satisfy you! 
- **Story points** ? It's an arbitrary measure, and it has drawbacks. Estimations often turns to be negotiation. It becomes currency (w/ value not comparable between teams), bring pressure, … Also, we often end up linking between story points and days of work.
- A **feature** is very variable thing, it's hard to measure
- **velocity** is a mono-dimensional thing against time.

> Using indicators as goals is a tragedy. There is a lot of tricks to cheat. (#Goodhart's Law)

Agile can be applied to a codebase to describe it's responsiveness, the fact it is easy to change.

Software != manufacture. 
Manufacture: each thing the same 

> **Doing agile makes you busy. Being agile makes you less busy.**

"The right way" = far complex to measure 

How do measure ability to respond to change ? By looking at the capacity to change direction, to accelerate, and to decelerate when necessary.

Conclusion: the secret = ability to slow down

## My thought: 
- I mostly agree with the mindset
- The comparison with manufacturer looks simplistic. Even in a manufacture, you want to measure defects (there is quality challenges), health of the workers is crucial (when this is a critical resource).
- Have you ever tried driving a car that never decelerate ? 
- In a nutshell: we often focus on velocity, pay attention to acceleration.
- Running in the wrong direction can make you lose a lot of time!
- Sometime, the fastest way of doing something is not to do it
