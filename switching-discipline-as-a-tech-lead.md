His story, of being Tech lead of a team when you have to learn a new technique.

## What is a tech lead ?

They are all wrong answers, but it's often.
- a senior engineer
- someone with leadership responsibilities on the team
- not a manager, still an individual contributor
- responsible for setting technical direction

You maybe a Tech leader if :
- you spend more time writing and reviewing documents than code
- your manager defers technical decision making to you 
- your calendar has more meetings with people outside the team than on the team
- you act as your team technical representative, without needing your manager in the room

## Switching discipline

What is a discipline ?
- Switching discipline != switching language
- Different discipline = different constraints (when you develop mobile apps, you have very limited computing resources, storage is critical, architecture are specific, it's very different than programming web applications)

When do actually people switch ?
- Sometime at the beginning (path error, ...)
- Sometime when a new discipline emerges and some jump in

Note: leaving make room for other to grow

What change when you change discipline? 
- Language
- Libraries
- Frameworks
- People you follow
- Architecture pattern you think in
- How comfortable you feel
- How challenged you are: some junior teammates will know more than you

What stay the same ?
- you still you
- where a good reviewer ? still
- where funny ? still

reviewing design docs
asking questions. Why ? What this does ? Can you walk me through the codebase ? What do people hate most working on this team ?
Meet with people : weekly 1:1 with team mate, pm.
Mentoring (listening, share embarrassing story about yourself to help someone feel better)
Pushing best practices

> You don’t have to tell everyone how smart you are.

## Is it worth it ?

- Seniority as an engineer require depth.
- As tech lead you are often T-shaped
- Now, I’m qualified for so many types of roles.
- I proved that I can learn new things

If interested in learning and growing on the staff plus stack: Yes, definitively it is worth it.

## Takeaway

Changing discipline is a big challenge that can bring you depth and shape you for staff + positions.
