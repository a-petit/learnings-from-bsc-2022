Architecting a new product

Challenge when you start a new thing in a big organisation

## Guidance

- Too little guidance: messy
- Too much guidance: micro-management

How just enough guidance looks like ?

You start with alignment: 
- Autonomy through alignment
- Freedom within a framework. 
- If the framework is clear, it makes. Analogy : driving a car
- which technology have an impact downstream ?

## Functionality

When a product has too little functionality: 
- misses core use cases (Apple maps underwater routes)
- inadequate performance (quality, reliability, …)
- Disappointing

When a product has too much functionality
- complicated to install, deploy, … confusing
- tries to be all things for all people (scala vs kotlin), inconsistencies
- Disappointing

What is just enough functionality ?

Design for 10x usage. If you expect 1 million. Design for 10.

## Conclusion

As an architect, you should think about:
- **influence rather than impact, this is how you become 10x , 100x developer**
- **if you are making decisions yourself, you are doing it wrong !**
