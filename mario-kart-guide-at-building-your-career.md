Has been crafting career during past years through coaching etc.

We often associate career to success.

## Don't compare yourself with others

Different perspectives:
- Me : as top 1 (enumerates his achievements)
- Me : as last one (enumerate his failures)

One image is very successful. Other very less

On social media, we share mostly one side (the successful one).

Compare to heroes is unfair and disappointing

Targeting something often implies down the hill and get through the valley before reaching your goal.

Don’t compete with others
- you have different talents
- you have different opportunities

## Compete with you ! 

That’s the good frame.

During coaching, he remarks that : 
- people struggle to have directions. 
- It’s important. Where do you want to go ?

> Set direction and use it as compass

Chess
With his son
Success depends on the perspective
Actually he achieved his goals


A good goal is a SMART goal.
- Specific
- Measurable
- Achievable
- Relevant: with direction you defined previously
- Time-bound

For some people, this will be enough. For some, it won’t. They will still be stucked.

At this stage, the trick is to **visualise** the desired state, project yourself.

## Learning

How do you like to learn?
- in solo (books, experiments)
- with others
- ...

> Figure out what work for you


## Progress

If you always play 50cc, you’ll never progress
If you start in hard mode, you’ll be overwhelmed, it won’t work. 

> **Pick right learning curve**.

Also pick the right environment ! One that supports your learning.

Be clear with your expectations.

Find an environment that is aligned with your culture and ambitions.

Hardware : fuck buy a good computer.

## Branding

Most people are not comfortable with this aspect at the beginning.

- Make sure people know what you do.
- Tell people what you want: most people will in fact help you.
- Give people opportunity to help you. This will also engage you.

Impostor syndrome is very common.
- When you are given an opportunity - it may be because someone trust you and you skills.
- To learn more about this syndrome, great talks has been given.

## Crash

You may crash. Even with experience.
Speaker experienced a big burnout - 5 months not able to work.
You may get helps: wife, your enterprise.

Burn-out symptoms:
- less energy
- missing goals
- change of behavior (I notice you don’t go biking anymore, …)

Find a balance.

# Conclusion

- Don't compare yourself with others, compete with you 
- figure what works for you for learning
- pick the right learning curve
- share what you do, tell what you want 
- find a balance
