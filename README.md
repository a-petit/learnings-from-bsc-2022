## Key takeaways

- [Code is a constrained form of literature, optimize it for readability.](software-as-literature.md) 
- [Doing agile makes you busy. Being agile makes you less busy](agility-neq-speed.md)
- Mental illness is an important issue in the Tech industry ; prioritize having fun
- Changing discipline is a big challenge, it brings you depth and can shape you for staff+ positions.
- Perception is matter of brain, not the eyes ; Don't be driven by fear ; Even if you are right, if you cannot exercise social intelligence, you will not be able to deliver your message
- There is no work like early work ; Don’t publish interfaces prematurely ; it’s not a problem of flow but of data structure.
- Two golden rules of intention in tests: 1) test the outcomes (what, not how ☠️) 2) test capabilities rather than data
- Be very conservative with what you put in an api. In production, people use them in « surprising »  and unexpected way.
- Design for disability may encounter global success ; Ask yourself: who am I intentionally excluding? who am I unintentionally excluding?
- Avoid goals, prefer system ; tiny habits over a long period lead to big achievements
- Don't compare yourself with others ; compete with you ; figure what works for you for learning ; pick the right learning curve ; share what you do, tell what you want ; find a balance
