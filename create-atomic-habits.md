Improve your system of habits

Good dev habits :
learn new skills
focus

4 stages of habits / rules
- Cue : make it obvious
- Craving : make it attractive
- Response : make it easy ; 1 chapter
- Reward : satisfying ; share w/ colleagues, track your habits

Example, learning :

Tips:
- Stack your habits
- Pair the context
- Two minutes rule : stay below that point it will look like working.
- Reduce frictions : download your podcast in advance so you can listen them online
- Design your environment to make it easy : keep your book close, put your phone far


Ok, now, how to break a bad habit ? Flip the image : 
- make it invisible, unattractive, difficult, unsatisfying.

Tips:
- Reduce exposure to bad habits
- Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit
- A commitment device : make choice that prevent you doing some things.
Accountably partner, someone you don’t want to disappoint
Habit contract : penalty, share with the world

Takeaway :
setting goal isn’t enough ; work on your system
tiny habits over long period lead to big gains

Thought :
grid simple to use in coaching, very interesting. Do you want us to work on your system ? An habit you want to break ? An habit you want to create ?
