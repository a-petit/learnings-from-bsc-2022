# Design for 8 billion humans
—

by Dona Sarkar (Microsoft)

BSC is my favorite conference. Focus on both mindfulness and health, architecture and tech stuff, agility. It's not usual to have those 3 pillars.

Turn on live-captions when you present
- Lot of people loss earring
- Some people are used to when they watch series and feel more comfortable this way

Reversing doubly linked list wont help you make impact or money. We didn't learn about accessibility, but it's something important.

How would 8 billions human use my product ?
- their is a lot of disabilities (vision, hear, neural, cognitive, …)
- everyone is going to have disability at some point.

Design for disability may encounter global success : 
- audiobooks have been made for blind people and are very popular today 
- there is a lot of examples of inventions from people with disability that reached global success

For wild products:
- test accessibility at design stage. 
- You may discover lot of surprising issues due to culture, skin color, head size, age, economic condition, tech literacy

Ask yourself:
- who am I intentionally excluding ?
- who am I unintentionally excluding ?

**The later a bug / issue is caught, the more expensive it cost**
